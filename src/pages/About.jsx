          my parents emigrated from Ethiopia in 1998, and I consider myself to
          have dual cultures—Ethiopian and American. one of my favorite
          traditions is the ceremonial coffee, known as "bunna."

        <p>
          the image here shows a non-traditional coffee setup, but it was taken
          in one of Addis Ababa’s vibrant cafes that hold special memories for
          me. for me, a life without coffee, both literally and symbolically, is
          not one I want.
